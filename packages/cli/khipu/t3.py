"""What Khipu knows about T3 Code (pingdotgg/t3code), read-only.

T3 lets one thread switch provider and account mid-conversation. Three facts of
its behaviour reach Khipu, all pinned in docs/plans/2026-10-07-khipu-t3.md:

  - its settings file names every Claude instance and the config folder
    (``homePath``) each one runs with;
  - the first turn after a switch carries a hand-over of earlier turns glued in
    front of what the user typed;
  - it runs helper Claude sessions (thread titles) in throwaway folders.

Khipu never writes T3's settings or database. Every read here degrades quietly:
a missing file, bad JSON or a changed shape is "nothing found", never an error.
